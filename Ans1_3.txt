ANSWER 1

In-place means that the algorithm does not use extra space for manipulating the input but may require a small though non-constant extra space for its operation. Usually, this space is O(log n), though sometimes anything in O(n) (Smaller than linear) is allowed.

Examples of in place Sorting Algorithms:-

Bubble Sort
Heap Sort
Insertion Sort
Quick Sort
Selection sort
Examples of not in place Algorithms :-

Merge Sort
Radix Sort
